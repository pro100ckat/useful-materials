1. Obtaining Trajan 2.1 Shareware

Trajan 2.1 Shareware is supplied as a compressed file, TRAJAN21.ZIP.
It can be obtained via the World Wide Web at the following address:

or by post to:

Dr. Andrew Hunter
Trajan Software Ltd.,
68 Lesbury Close,
Chester-le-street,
Co. Durham,
DH2 3SR.
United Kingdom.

Shareware is not provided via mail except by prior agreement, in which case 
handling charges will be incurred.

2. Installing Trajan 2.1 Shareware

The Shareware is supplied as a zipped distribution file, trajan21.zip.
You can unpack this using any of a number of commercial, shareware and
freeware decompression packages, many available via the Internet.
For example, with PKUNZIP, type the following in DOS:

PKUNZIP TRAJAN21.ZIP

When unzipped, the distribution creates a directory called TRAJAN21, which 
includes a setup program, SETUP.EXE, together with a an archive file 
TRAJAN.AR.

Run the SETUP.EXE program in Windows, either by double-clicking on it in the
File Manager, or by selecting File/Run in the Program Manager and entering 
SETUP as the command.

The setup program creates a directory (by default, C:\TRAJAN, although you
will be given the chance to change this if you wish).

In Windows 95 the Trajan program is then accessible via the Start button.

In Windows 3.1, the SETUP program also creates a Program Group in
Program Manager, which also includes an Icon for the program and
for this Readme file.
